my test repo
A line I wrote on Nemertes
another line
Here is a line added from RStudio! 
And a second line added from RStudio! 
Pushing from the Terminal shell git version no longer works,
perhaps because of conflicting HTTPS (RStudio) and SSH (shell) settings. 
This is the third commit from RStudio. 
I n the second push, there were no more requests for username and password, good!
